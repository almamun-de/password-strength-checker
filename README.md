# Password Strength Checker

## Description

This is a simple Python script that checks the strength of a password based on the following rules:

- The password must be at least 8 characters long.
- The password must contain at least one uppercase letter.
- The password must contain at least one lowercase letter.
- The password must contain at least one digit.
- The password must contain at least one special character.

If the password meets all the criteria, it will be considered **Strong**. Otherwise, the script will inform you which criteria the password fails.
